\section{Projects}
\vspace{-4pt}
{\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
{\bf Crossbar Scheduling} \hfill 2016.2 - Present\break
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Designed the {\bf first} parallel iterative crossbar scheduling algorithm which has constant per-port time complexity and can provably achieve the same performance (both throughput and delay) guarantees as the family of maximal matching based schedulers that have at least logarithmic per-port time complexity.\hfill\break}
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Designed a crossbar scheduling algorithm that can exactly emulate the linear-time centralized counterpart ({\it i.e.,} SERENA) in logarithmic rounds. (IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking under submission)\hfill\break}
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Designed a simple yet effective ``add-on'' crossbar scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches, which can boost the performance (throughput or delay or both) of existing crossbar scheduling algorithms ({\it e.g.}, iSLIP and SERENA) with almost ``no'' computational overhead. (SIGMETRICS 2017)\hfill\break}
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Built an efficient and flexible input-queued switch simulator in C++.\hfill\break}
\sspace

}
{\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
{\bf Time Capsule for Online Social Activities} \hfill 2015.9 - Present\break
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Designed a hybrid streaming-sampling algorithm for high accurate measurements of Online Social Networking (OSN) cascade statistics, using limited memory, which decreased the errors (measured in $\ell_2$) by more than one order of magnitude. (ICCCN 2017)\hfill\break}
\sspace

}
{\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
{\bf Network Virtualization} \hfill 2012.2 - 2015.6\break
% {\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Designed a novel virtual network embedding algorithm, which increased the network utilization and decreased the time complexity. (INFOCOM 2014)\hfill\break}
% {\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Proposed the {\bf first} integer linear programming formulations for the virtual optical network embedding problems in the contexts of flexible-grid elastic optical networks, and designed efficient algorithms which achieved much better performance. (Journal of Lightwave Technology)\hfill\break}
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Proved the {\bf first} inapproximability result of the location-constrained virtual network embedding (LC-VNE) problems, and designed efficient algorithms for solving LC-VNE achieving much better performance (in terms of both resource consumption and fairness). (IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking)\hfill\break}
{\hspace*{1em} $\bullet$ Built the {\bf first} OpenFlow-based network virtualization platform in which the underlying infrastructure is the flexible-grid elastic optical networks. (Master Thesis)\hfill\break}
