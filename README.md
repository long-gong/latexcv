# LaTeXCV: A LaTeX CV Maker based on Python

## Requirements and Setup

To use this tool, you need at least have `Python` being installed.

You can simply install python dependencies by using: `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`. If you only need to generate `LaTeX` file(s), then that is enough. If you want to generate PDF(s), then please make sure you have installed and configured `LaTeX` software (_e.g._ `texlive` on Linux or `MikTeX` on Windows).
